### System Notifications
When Claude needs your attention:

## Voice Variations

The system automatically selects different voices for:
- **Normal operations**: Default confident voice
- **Errors/Failures**: Deeper, more serious voice
- **Alerts**: Urgent, attention-grabbing voice
- **Pre-operations**: Slightly varied for distinction

## Tips for Best Demo

1. **Restart Claude** before the demo to ensure all hooks are loaded
2. **Turn up your volume** so your friend can hear clearly
3. **Run operations in sequence** with small pauses between them
4. **Show both success and failure** scenarios for dramatic effect
5. **Demonstrate git operations** - they sound particularly cool
6. **Try test runs** - the pass/fail detection is impressive

## Quick Demo Script

Here's a quick sequence to show off all features:

```
1. "Create a file called demo.js with some JavaScript code"
2. "Read demo.js"
3. "Edit demo.js and add a comment"
4. "Search for the word 'demo' in all files"
5. "Run git status"
6. "Create a git commit"
7. "List all files in the current directory"
```

Each command will trigger PreToolUse (before) and PostToolUse (after) announcements!

**Pro Tip**: The JARVIS voice system works with ALL Claude Code tools, so any operation you do will have appropriate audio feedback!

# JARVIS Voice - Project Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

A drop-in voice notification system for Claude Code that provides intelligent, context-aware audio feedback for all operations. Named after Tony Stark's AI assistant, JARVIS announces what Claude is doing in real-time with smart phrase selection and optional premium AI voices.

## üì¶ What's Included

### Core Components

1. **`bin/cc-voice`** - The main voice script
   - Reads hook events from stdin
   - Detects tool types and context
   - Smart phrase generation
   - Dynamic voice selection
   - Cross-platform audio playback
   - ElevenLabs integration with caching

2. **`install.sh`** - Automated installer
   - Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
   - Detects OS and configures appropriately
   - Backs up existing settings
   - Sets up environment variables
   - Interactive ElevenLabs configuration

3. **`config/claude-settings-hooks.json`** - Hook configuration
   - PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks for all major tools
   - Event hooks (Stop, SubagentStop, SessionEnd, Notification)
   - Ready to merge or use standalone

### Documentation

- **`README.md`** - Main documentation with features, installation, examples
- **`docs/interactive-demo.md`** - Step-by-step demo guide
- **`docs/demo.sh`** - Automated demo script
- **`docs/VOICE-IDS.md`** - Complete ElevenLabs voice reference
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Contribution guidelines
- **`LICENSE`** - MIT License

### Configuration Files

- **`package.json`** - Node.js package metadata
- **`.gitignore`** - Excludes secrets, caches, OS files

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Tool-Specific Announcements

## üîí Security Notes

‚úÖ **Safe to share:**
- All code is clean and contains no secrets
- `.gitignore` excludes `.env` files and sensitive data
- Installation script prompts for API keys (not stored in repo)
- API keys are written to user's shell profile, not committed

‚ùå **Never commit:**
- ElevenLabs API keys
- Any `.env` files
- User-specific settings with secrets

## üìä Project Statistics

- **Total Files**: 11
- **Documentation Pages**: 5
- **Lines of Code**: ~400 (cc-voice script)
- **Supported Platforms**: macOS, Linux, Windows
- **Voice Options**: 40+ ElevenLabs voices + system TTS

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test on other platforms** - Verify Linux/Windows compatibility
